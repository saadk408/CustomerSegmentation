# CustomerSegmentation

This project applies Reinforcement Machine Learning algorithms to real-life data from a wholesale retailer's customer purchase data to discover customer segments. We were able to split the customers into 2 major segments, which detailed their purchasing habits and trends. Using these segments, we were able to help the wholesale retailer devise a A/B Testing plan to test changes in delivery schedules.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `customer_segments/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook customer_segments.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook customer_segments.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Data

The customer segments data is included as a selection of 440 data points collected on data found from clients of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal. More information can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers).
