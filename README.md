# CustomerSegmentation

# This project applies Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms to real-life data from a wholesale retailer's customer purchase data to discover customer segments. We were able to split the customers into 2 major segments, which detailed their purchasing habits and trends. Using these segments, we were able to help the wholesale retailer devise a A/B Testing plan to test changes in delivery schedules.
